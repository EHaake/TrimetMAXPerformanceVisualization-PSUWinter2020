# TrimetPerformanceVisualization-PSUWinter2020
### By Dan Durecka and Erik Haake

##Project Goal

To try and quantify the performance differences between different paradigms in route configuration in the Trimet Max System.

##Project Summary

This project will analyse and visualize the on-time performance (actual vs scheduled) of the Trimet MAX rail system by paradigm in route configuration. There are 3 distinct paradigms in route configuration which are: Sections in which the MAX has exclusive right-of-way, sections where there are at-grade vehicle traffic crossings, and sections where the rail is in the road and can share a lane with vehicle traffic. 

Upon completion, this project will hopefully provide insight into the differences in performance between these paradigms that will allow the city to make better decisions regarding new rail sections in the future, or modifications of the current rail system.

Once the relevant data has been procured, it will be filtered and aggregated into a custom or a series of custom .csv files that will be inserted into a visualization tool to create relevant and illustrative visualizations of the data. These visualizations will be presented in a website that provides context for the data and annotates and describes the visualizations.

##Team Roles

Dan will be the designated data wrangler who will procure and filter out the unnecessary data.
Erik will be the visualization chief and all around ‘design guy’. Both will work on the manual mapping of the data into the separate regions and paradigms and mapping the density of intersections. Dan will be the coordinator in charge of scheduling meetings and coordinating communication.
